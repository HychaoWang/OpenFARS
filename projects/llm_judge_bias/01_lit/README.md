# Literature Retrieval Notes

- Store retrieved abstracts, links, and bib entries for judge bias calibration and GSM8K grading.
- Include conflict/overlap notes: when a paper already answers the hypothesis, mark it to avoid duplicate work.
- Keep a `sources.json` cache if you script retrieval to stay within token and network budgets.
